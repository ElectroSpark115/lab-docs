# Withdrawal & Deployment Fees

On this page, we will cover the designated fees and how Epicentral Labs plans on continuing its establishment on Solana while creating project token utility, sustainability, and community loyalty.

## Fractional-Fee Model

Epicentral Labs has implemented a structured fee system to sustain a [Vaults](/terminology#vault) lifetime as well as community loyalty for the associated project. 

This involves one primary withdrawal fee split between the associated [Vault](/terminology#vault), [Vault Creator](/terminology#vault-creator), and an extra fee route of the Vault Creator's choice. This can be of their choice:

* **A [DAO](/terminology#decentralized-autonomous-organization-dao) Treasury of choice.**
* **Another Wallet/Team Wallet Address of choice.**
* **Route back into the associated Vault for extra sustainability.**

This fractional-fee model is designed to balance the incentive structure across all users while supporting the initial Vault Creator. 

## Withdrawal Fees:

However, it can also be be allocated to any other address. |
