# About Us

We are ***Epicentral Labs***, a development studio and project incubator on Solana based in US and Canada. We are a group of passionate developers and project managers whose goal is to introduce innovative solutions and services for new or already existing Solana-based projects. Our goal is to connect, collaborate, and educate todays webspace with how blockchain can immerse user experience. By providing support to new and upcoming projects and collaborating with large, well established projects, Epicentral Labs will become the place to go to for start ups that wish to make a difference in the Web3 space.

## Our Focus

Our focus is to simplify Solana to non-crypto-savvy internet junkies by utilizing new/existing ideas, products, and services.

We wish to most importantly educate the flexibility of both already-existing applications and decentralized applications to initiate further growth to the Solana Community. We are passionate to bring everyday non-crypto-oriented folks into understanding of what more can be achieved for investors, consumers and developers. Whether we focus on gaming, security, decentralized finance or something else -- the end goal is to showcase that Solana is more than "just crypto" to the rest of the world. 

Currently, we are focused on quite a few interesting sub-projects, one of which is building a new DeFi platform for new and existing spl-token projects to create new incentives for their community. We like to call them [Vault-Programs](/vault-program-docs/introduction) -- a customizable staking vault made simple! 

Right now, the **problem** that we've noticed on Solana is that some projects don't have the appropriate support in order to accelerate its growth to its community and even token price. So,Epicentral Labs wants to provide tools, consultation and solutions for projects that seek that support -- which can be done in many ways as we've listed (i.e. Gamifying, Security, Financing, etc).

At some point in the future, we wish to use any raised funds from fees or DAO treasury to either provide grants and sponsorships into start up projects or buying back [LABS Tokens](/introduction/labstoken).

The full capabilities of Solana is only now being realized and we are passionate to showcase that.

## Why do we need Docs?

This documentation site is made mainly to help keep track of all changelogs among our different sub-projects in one place and for ease of readibility and collaboration between our Epicentral Team. Because let's be honest, GitBook is just too expensive for what it is for a start up...
