# About Us

***Epicentral Labs*** is a small team based in the United States that focuses on creating innovative solutions for OnChain problems including but not limited to integrating DeFi, Tokenization, and Real World Applications with [Solana](https://solana.com/). 

## Our Focus

The goal is to introduce democratization into new/existing ideas, products, services and expanding on them. However, it’s important not to think too largely. It’s just as important, to focus on smaller problems/ideas before tackling the big ones.

We want to connect, collaborate, educate, and grow the Solana Community as well as our everyday non-crypto-oriented folks into understanding of what more can be achieved for investors, consumers and developers.

Currently, we are focused on building the appropriate platform for new and existing spl-token projects to create new incentives for their community through what we like to call: [Vault-Programs](/vault-program-docs/introduction).

The current **problem** that we've noticed with Solana is that projects don't have the appropriate support in order to accelerate to its limits. Epicentral Labs wants to provide tools, consultation and solutions for projects that seek that support. 

At some point in the future, we wish to use raised funds to provide grants into other start up projects because at the end of the day Epicentral Labs are project managers.

The full capabilities of Solana is only now being realized.

## Why do we need Docs?

This documentation site is made mainly to help keep track of all changelogs among our different projects in one place and for ease of readibility and collaboration between our team. Because to be honest, GitBook is just too expensive for what it is...
