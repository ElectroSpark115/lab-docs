# About Us

Epicentral Labs is a small team based in the United States that focuses on creating innovative solutions for OnChain problems on [Solana](https://solana.com/).

## Our Focus

Currently, we are focused on building the appropriate platform for new and existing spl-token projects to create new incentives for their community through what we like to call: [Vault-Programs](/vault-program-docs/introduction).

## Why do we need Docs?

This documentation site is made mainly to help keep track of all changelogs among our different projects in one place and for ease of readibility and collaboration between our team. Because to be honest, GitBook is just too expensive for what it is...
